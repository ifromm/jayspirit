This is JaySpirit, the Java API for HySpirit. It provides some convenience
classes and a Java interface to execute several HySpirit tools like hyp_pd
and hyp_pra. It also provides classes to parse the output directly to Java
objects for further processing. JaySpirit requires a running HySpirit
installation and does not work without it. Please contact Thomas Roelleke
<thor@eecs.qmul.ac.uk> to obtain HySpirit.

This project uses maven for any compilation, installation and testing. To
compile, type

  mvn compile

To test, type

  mvn test

Please note some tests may be ignored if no HySpirit environment (check
$HYSPIRIT) is found. It is strongly recommended to run the tests in a
working HySpirit environment.

To create a .jar file, use

  mvn assembly:assembly

This will create two JaySpirit .jar files in the 'target' directory: one with
and one without dependencies. Consult the documentation of the Assembly plugin
for further details.

If you want to install JaySpirit in your local maven directory (usually
$HOME/.m2/) use

  mvn install


If you intend to make changes to the source code and would like to upload them
to the repository, please contact Ingo Frommholz <ingo@frommholz.org> for
